I sincerely thank my advisor Dr. Abhishek Bichhawat for helping me all along my masters journey.

I thank my grandmother who made me the person I am today, my family
for their love and unconditional support, and my friends for listening to my rants all day.

I thank Ms. Nikita Yadav for her talk that provided me with the inspiration for this work.
Her support in sharing BLAST prototype and her willingness to help me resolve my silly doubts
along the way has made it possible for me to complete everything on time (almost).

I specially thank ARM, OP-TEE, and LLVM projects for their fragmented, rarely updated,
and cryptic documentations respectively. I could not do anything without those,
regardless of how much I struggled.

I am grateful to Ulrik Lyngs for making the [`oxforddown`](https://github.com/ulyngs/oxforddown) package that helped me write
this thesis, and [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/en/) for the amazing work done for `bookdown` and the R community in general.
I was happily surprised to know that the person whose minimal blog theme I use is so big
in the community.
