Programs have vulnerabilities in them that allow adversaries to take control of
the program. The order of execution of instructions in a program for a given input
is called the program control-flow. CFA mechanisms aim to provide an evidence of
program execution integrity, while CFI mechanisms aim to enforce execution integrity.
Work in both fields has been mostly a parallel endeavour. Hybrid approaches have not
yet been explored properly. CFA+ proposed a solution bridging this gap. We identify
flaws in CFA+ design that make it vulnerable. We extend BLAST, a whole program
CFA scheme to add integrity guarantees. We see an avenue to optimise it due to
the hybrid approach, and test a solution that is faster and more secure than BLAST.
This work is a step towards the ideal of a hybrid scheme that performs
local verification to provide integrity to critical-systems.
