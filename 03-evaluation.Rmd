## Qualitative Security Analysis

For our case, an attacker either controls the Prv or is a malicious Prv that changes
the control flow of the program, while trying to keep the CFlog intact 
or succeeds in completing malicious operations before Vrf gets the report.
We can show that our extensions to BLAST add some integrity guarantees and 
make this harder to do. Some of these guarantees are inherited from BLAST, and
as described in [#implementation], we add on top of them instead of losing any.

- Reliable delivery can be added on top
TA can be configured to send continuout reports, and CFI fault handlers to kill + report.
