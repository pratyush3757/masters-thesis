## Limitations
[Edit/Add to this part]{highlight="pink"}

Although not a limitation in this work, our aim was to add checks in the TEE 
that would monitor the program execution and if integrity has been violated, 
abort the execution. We can pursue this further by modifying CFLAT/OAT monitor.

The benchmarks do not include whole program path generation part. 

The logging on violation part, although mentioned has not been implemented yet 
in the prototype. This can also be implementation dependent and users may choose 
to abort execution instead of logging.

Some of the assumptions like write XOR execute are not foolproof and there are 
proof of concepts exploiting them. We need to decrease the TCB and the 
assumptions to increase the security guarantees given by this work.

Could not add other CFI measures than PAC and BTI. 

PAC is only enabled if the whole dependency chain also has it enabled so we 
cannot use PAC with pre-compiled binaries that do not have it enabled.

The benchmarking was done on a simulated Raspberry pi inside qemu instead of a 
hardware board. Thus we have only taken the ratio of baseline code and the 
instrumented code. The timings may differ a bit on a physical board.

## Why is it better than CFA+
