# Extending BLAST for CFI

\minitoc <!-- this will include a mini table of contents-->

## Why?

CFA mechanisms rely on the fact that a malicious actor would not want their attack 
to be detected. And for this there attack must not leave any trace in the log that 
would be visible to the verifier. But what if the attacker does not care about if 
their attack is visible or not, if the damage is done? Code reuse attacks become 
very easy in this case, as most CFA techniques aim to detect them, but not prevent them.

Taking the example of the syringe pump, if an attacker has used ROP gadgets to 
change the control flow of the pump to inject 10 ml instead of 1 ml, it doesn't 
matter if we can detect if afterwards as the person's safety has already been compromised.

Our goal in this case is to prevent these kinds of scenarios.

People have been working on CFI and CFA parallelly as two solutions to similar 
problems, but they have not thought about applying both of these together. 
When applied together, these techniques sometimes complement each other and cover 
each other's disadvantages. For example, adding integrity to some parts of the 
code would remove the need for logging those parts, decreasing the attestation 
overhead, which is a common problem in the CFA literature. 

[Also write about the constant monitor for input idea]{highlight="pink"} 

Before going forward, we should list out some of our assumptions:

- Write XOR Execute is enabled on pages.
- Hardware is implicitly trusted.
- Communication between Vrf and Prv is secure.
- OS is not trusted if and only if [page management?]{highlight="pink"} is handled
by the secure monitor.

## What can be done to add Integrity guarantees?

## PAC + BTI gives us room to optimize BLAST

## Log Levels for control over Report Granularity
