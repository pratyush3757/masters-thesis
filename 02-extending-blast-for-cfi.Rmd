# Extending BLAST for CFI

\minitoc <!-- this will include a mini table of contents-->

*Armed* with the background information, we can now take a look at why and how we can improve
upon BLAST to give additional security guarantees, and maybe get a bit of a performance boost
while we are at it.

## Why?

CFA mechanisms rely on the fact that a malicious actor would not want their attack
to be detected. And for this there attack must not leave any trace in the log that
would be visible to the verifier. But what if the attacker does not care about if
their attack is visible or not, if the damage is done? Code reuse attacks become
very easy in this case, as most CFA techniques aim to detect them, but not prevent them.

Taking the example of the syringe pump, if an attacker has used ROP gadgets to
change the control flow of the pump to inject 10 ml instead of 1 ml, it doesn't
matter if we can detect if afterwards as the person's safety has already been compromised.

Our goal in this case is to prevent these kinds of scenarios.

People have been working on CFI and CFA parallelly as two solutions to similar
problems, but they have not thought about applying both of these together [@sok; @cfaplus].
When applied together, these techniques sometimes complement each other and cover
each other's disadvantages. For example, adding integrity to some parts of the
code would remove the need for logging those parts, decreasing the runtime overhead
due to attestation, which is a common problem in the CFA literature [@sok].

[CFA+ is there, but the limitations are listed, we need better solution.]{highlight="pink"}

[Also write about the constant monitor for input idea. BLAST is experiment in that direction]{highlight="pink"}

Before going forward, we should list out some of our assumptions:

- Write XOR Execute (`W` $\oplus$ `X`) is enabled on pages. Code injection/modification in not possible.
- Hardware is implicitly trusted.
- Communication between Vrf and Prv is secure.
- OS is not trusted if and only if page management and interrupt handling is mediated
by the secure monitor.
- Libraries are instrumented and statically linked to the binary.

## How to add Integrity guarantees?{#adding-integrity}

As discussed in [1.1.1 - CFI](#cfi), when talking about code reuse attacks, they can be further divided into 
Control flow hijacking (control data) and Data only (non-control data) attacks.
We will talk about preventing control flow hijacking attacks first.
The two main categories of control flow hijacking attacks are: ROP and JOP.
We have talked about them in ARM Specifics [1.2.2 - PAC](#pac-bg) and [1.2.3 - BTI](#bti-bg) respectively.

Adding BTI to a binary would prevent JOP attacks disabling an attacker from changing
the control flow of the program and corrupting the forward edges of the CFG.
Use of `BR`, `BLR` and similar instructions to pivot to arbitrary code would generate hardware 
level exceptions, which could then be logged and handled appropriately.

Similarly, adding PAC to a binary would prevent ROP attacks, disabling corruption 
of backward egdes of the CFG.
Use of `RET` instructions to chain gadgets to run arbitrary code would become hard
as all returns would be preceded by an address check. Failing which would generate
a hardware level exception.

We can also optionally enable Memory Tagging Extension (MTE), or memory coloring,
an Armv8.5-A extension [@arm-pacbti]. It enables detection of memory safety violations like use after free
and buffer overflows by assigning tags to memory regions. Any data access would 
require a tag check in the address. Checking and Violations can be handled both
synchronously and asynchronously depending on performance needs.
As the tags, like PAC, use upper bits of the address, PAC would have fewer bits available.

But, MTE support for processors and Kernel is in early stage and is actively being worked upon [@mte-kern-patch].
Therefore, we will skip this feature for now and it can be used in the future when platforms
have better support for it.

We have some more instructions provided by the PAC and BTI feature flags,
like `BLRAA` - Authenticate and branch, or `RETAA` - Authenticate and return.
But they are not in the NOP-space. So for the sake of backwards compatibility,
we choose to not use them for now.

#### But, do PAC and BTI help in limiting the number of gadgets?

According to ARM's testing, when these features were enabled for GLIBC, the number 
of available gadgets was reduced by 97.65%. This can be seen in figure \@ref(fig:pac-bti-gadgets).
Similar results were also seen for CFA+ [@cfaplus].

```{r pac-bti-gadgets, fig.cap="ROP and JOP gadgets in GLIBC", out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./imgs/placeholder-pac-bti-gadgets.png")
```

#### What about the binary size overhead then?

Binary size overhead for these, when checked for GLIBC by ARM, was 2.9% for both
when considering backwards compatibility. If compiled for Armv8.3-A and later,
it drops to 1.61% [@arm-pacbti].
This overhead is less significant when compared to BLAST instrumentation, which
came to 64% without inlining [@blast].

[We will discuss this further in #eval after we implement extended BLAST.]{highlight="pink"}

#### What is our target compatibility?

As mentioned previously, PAC and BTI can be backwards compatible with ARMv8-A processors
that do not support them, but will just be treated as `NOP` instructions.
The same binary would run on ARMv8.5-A processors with PAC + BTI guarantees, and 
ARMv8.3-A with BTI turned off.
We also should keep in mind that PAC support is only enabled if the linked libraries
are also PAC enabled.
Compatibility is discussed in further detail in section [3.2 Compatibility](#compatibility).

## PAC + BTI gives us room to optimize BLAST{#optimizing-blast}

Now that we have checks on branches and calls, we do not need to log each loop's iteration.
Loop labels are protected by `BTI j` landing pads. They cannot be jumped to arbitrarily.
And as for the jumps: `B`, `B.cond`, `BL` have labels, and are direct branches protected 
against code modification.
While `BR` and `BLR` use registers, and would not be used for loop control, 
they still cannot jump arbitrarily as they would be preceded by pointer authentication.
Similarly, funtion returns aren't required to target landing pads, and may target loop labels, 
but due to PAC, all returns would be authenticated first.

Due to this, we can skip logging each loop iteration which would result in less 
log entries, and subsequently less number of domain switches. The amount of logging 
decreased can be seen in \@ref(tab:logevent-totals).
The performance benifits are discussed in [3.3 Performance](#performance).

## Log Levels for control over report granularity

Now, what if we need fine-grained CFlog reports with each log iteration, etc?
Or what if we need more performance out of extended BLAST at the cost of CFlog granularity?

We can add log levels to BLAST then. These are:

- *Violation*: Coarse-grained. Only PAC/BTI faults are logged and handled.
- *Inter-procedure*: Extended BLAST. Loop events aren't logged.
- *Intra-procedure*: Fine-grained. Original BLAST. Loop events are logged at cost of performance.

One thing to note here is that, BLAST instrumentation is added statically to the binary.
This means the log levels are set at compile time, and cannot be changed at runtime.
