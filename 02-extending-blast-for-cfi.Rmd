# Extending BLAST for CFI

\minitoc <!-- this will include a mini table of contents-->

*Armed* with the background information, we can now take a look at why and how we can improve
upon BLAST to give additional security guarantees, and maybe get a bit of a performance boost
while we are at it.

## Why?

CFA mechanisms rely on the fact that a malicious actor would not want their attack
to be detected. And for this there attack must not leave any trace in the log that
would be visible to the verifier. But what if the attacker does not care about if
their attack is visible or not, if the damage is done? Code reuse attacks become
very easy in this case, as most CFA techniques aim to detect them, but not prevent them.

Taking the example of the syringe pump, if an attacker has used ROP gadgets to
change the control flow of the pump to inject 10 ml instead of 1 ml, it doesn't
matter if we can detect if afterwards as the person's safety has already been compromised.

Our goal in this case is to prevent these kinds of scenarios.

People have been working on CFI and CFA parallelly as two solutions to similar
problems, but they have not thought about applying both of these together [@sok; @cfaplus].
When applied together, these techniques sometimes complement each other and cover
each other's disadvantages. For example, adding integrity to some parts of the
code would remove the need for logging those parts, decreasing the runtime overhead
due to attestation, which is a common problem in the CFA literature [@sok].

The idea that inspired this work is the question that if the Vrf has knowledge (in some way) 
of the expected control ﬂow, it can share the expectation with the RoT on the Prv,
which would be able to prevent anomalies immediately instead of reporting after
the damage has been done. The goal would then be to add modiﬁcations to the TEE
which would get the expected control ﬂow along with the input, monitor the program
execution, and take action if the integrity has been violated. 
This work is an experiment towards that goal.

CFA+ has done some work in that regard, but their design has some flaws discussed in
section [1.3.2 CFA+ Limitations](#cfaplus-limitations) which make it vulnerable to attacks.

Before going forward, we should list out some of our assumptions:

- Data Execution Prevention (DEP) or Write XOR Execute (`W` $\oplus$ `X`) is enabled
on pages. Code injection/modification in not possible.
DEP being enabled is a common assumption in CFI and CFA literature, to protect
the integrity of the instrumentation and to avoid code injection [@sok].
- Hardware is implicitly trusted. Any attacks on hardware, or it being malicious
would remove any trust anchors in the system.
- Communication between Vrf and Prv is secure. Insecure communication is considered
a problem unrelated to the one at hand. A malicious actor spoofing the Vrf could
run any program, and similarly spoof Prv to give a fake report.
- OS is not trusted if and only if page management and interrupt handling is mediated
by the secure monitor. This is because a malicious or compromised OS could easily
replace register values and other sensitive data needed for attestation. It could also
remove DEP protections, enabling code injection attacks.
- Libraries are instrumented and statically linked to the binary. Handling shared
libraries adds another level of complexity, and is not considered by many defences
[@cfaplus]. Also, PAC does not support partially enabled toolchains. i.e. All
linked libraries should have PAC enabled for it to be enabled for a binary.
Instrumenting and statically linking libraries would ensure this feature is enabled.

## How to add Integrity guarantees?{#adding-integrity}

As discussed in [1.1.1 - CFI](#cfi), when talking about code reuse attacks, they can be further divided into 
Control flow hijacking (control data) and Data only (non-control data) attacks.
We will talk about preventing control flow hijacking attacks first.
The two main categories of control flow hijacking attacks are: ROP and JOP.
We have talked about them in ARM Specifics [1.2.2 - PAC](#pac-bg) and [1.2.3 - BTI](#bti-bg) respectively.

`BTI` instructions act as landing pads for branch targets. Any jump not landing on a `BTI`
instruction would generate a Branch Target Exception. Function returns are also a
type of indirect branch, but they aren’t required to target the landing pads. 
The returns are secured by pointer authentication.
Also, for function entry, pointer signing instructions `PACIxSP` and `PACIxZ` act like
landing pads.

Adding BTI to a binary would prevent JOP attacks disabling an attacker from changing
the control flow of the program and corrupting the forward edges of the CFG.
Use of `BR`, `BLR` and similar instructions to pivot to arbitrary code would generate hardware 
level exceptions, which could then be logged and handled appropriately.

Similarly, adding PAC to a binary would prevent ROP attacks, disabling corruption 
of backward egdes of the CFG.
At the start of the function, the `LR` is signed. And it is authenticated just
before the return. If the check fails, an exception is raised.
Use of `RET` instructions to chain gadgets to run arbitrary code would become hard
as all returns would be preceded by an address check. Failing which would generate
a hardware level exception. To perform a ROP attack, attacker would need properly
signed addresses. And this whole process is dynamic in nature, so everytime the
program runs, keys for signing are different, forcing the attacker to calculate the
signatures again.

The CFA instrumentation would detect any deviation from the CFG, including for 
data attacks [@blast]. Further adding security to the control flow, as the TA can be 
configured to monitor the state of the program and take action when any anomaly
is detected.

We can also optionally enable Memory Tagging Extension (MTE), or memory coloring,
an Armv8.5-A extension [@arm-pacbti]. It enables detection of memory safety violations like use after free
and buffer overflows by assigning tags to memory regions. Any data access would 
require a tag check in the address. Checking and Violations can be handled both
synchronously and asynchronously depending on performance needs.
As the tags, like PAC, use upper bits of the address, PAC would have fewer bits available.

But, MTE support for processors and Kernel is in early stage and is actively being worked upon [@mte-kern-patch].
Therefore, we will skip this feature for now and it can be used in the future when platforms
have better support for it.

We have some more instructions provided by the PAC and BTI feature flags,
like `BLRAA` - Authenticate and branch, or `RETAA` - Authenticate and return.
But they are not in the NOP-space. So for the sake of backwards compatibility,
we choose to not use them for now.

#### But, do PAC and BTI help in limiting the number of gadgets?

According to ARM's testing, when these features were enabled for GLIBC, the number 
of available gadgets was reduced by 97.65%. This can be seen in figure \@ref(fig:pac-bti-gadgets).
Similar results were also seen for CFA+ [@cfaplus].

```{r pac-bti-gadgets, fig.cap="ROP and JOP gadgets in GLIBC", out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./imgs/placeholder-pac-bti-gadgets.png")
```

#### What about the binary size overhead then?

Binary size overhead for these, when checked for GLIBC by ARM, was 2.9% for both
when considering backwards compatibility. If compiled for Armv8.3-A and later,
it drops to 1.61% [@arm-pacbti].
This overhead is less significant when compared to BLAST instrumentation, which
came to 64% without inlining [@blast].

#### What is our target compatibility?

As mentioned previously, PAC and BTI can be backwards compatible with ARMv8-A processors
that do not support them, but will just be treated as `NOP` instructions.
The same binary would run on ARMv8.5-A processors with PAC + BTI guarantees, and 
ARMv8.3-A with BTI turned off.
We also should keep in mind that PAC support is only enabled if the linked libraries
are also PAC enabled.
Compatibility is discussed in further detail in section [3.2 Compatibility](#compatibility).

## PAC + BTI gives us room to optimize BLAST{#optimizing-blast}

Now that we have checks on branches and calls, we do not need to log each loop's iteration.
Loop labels are protected by `BTI j` landing pads. They cannot be jumped to arbitrarily.
And as for the jumps: `B`, `B.cond`, `BL` have labels, and are direct branches protected 
against code modification.
While `BR` and `BLR` use registers, and would not be used for loop control, 
they still cannot jump arbitrarily as they would be preceded by pointer authentication.
Similarly, funtion returns aren't required to target landing pads, and may target loop labels, 
but due to PAC, all returns would be authenticated first.

Due to this, we can skip logging each loop iteration which would result in less 
log entries, and subsequently less number of domain switches. The amount of logging 
decreased can be seen in table \@ref(tab:logevent-totals).
The performance benifits are discussed in [3.3 Performance](#performance).

## Log Levels for control over report granularity

Now, what if we need fine-grained CFlog reports with each log iteration, etc?
Or what if we need more performance out of extended BLAST at the cost of CFlog granularity?

We can add log levels to BLAST then. These are:

- *Violation*: Coarse-grained. Only PAC/BTI faults are logged and handled. Equivalent to CFA+.
- *Optimised*: Extended BLAST. Loop events aren't logged. Balanced performance and granularity.
- *Full*: Fine-grained. Loop events are logged at cost of performance. Equivalent to reference BLAST.

One thing to note here is that, BLAST instrumentation is added statically to the binary.
This means the log levels are set at compile time, and cannot be changed at runtime.

`Violation` log level would have the least amount of evidence collected for attestation,
with only faults logged. This would have the best performance out of the three levels
at the cost of attestation evidence granularity. Looking at CFA+, it can be considered
similar to `Violation` level here. Users can choose `Full` level
for when they need block level fine grained evidence, same as reference BLAST.
It would also be the slowest level, but with the most information given to the Vrf.
`Optimised` level would be a balance between the two, by gaining performance
only at the cost of not being able to log the number of loop iterations.
